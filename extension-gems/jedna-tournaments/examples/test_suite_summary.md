## Key Insights from Tests:

1. **Wild card conservation is working** - The agent successfully avoids wasting wd4
2. **War handling is good** - Reverse counter-play is working correctly
3. **Extreme situations handled well** - Opponent at 1 card and self at 2 cards
4. **Chain detection needs work** - Not finding optimal play sequences
5. **Card value assessment needs improvement** - Not recognizing isolated cards or saving action cards

## Test-Driven Development Plan:

1. Fix chain detection to pass the g4 test
2. Improve isolated card recognition
3. Add logic to save action cards when opponent has many cards
4. Add more edge case tests as we discover them

## Additional Tests to Consider:

1. Double card plays (playing two identical cards)
2. War continuation decisions
3. End-game scenarios (both players low on cards)
4. Color change strategies
5. Skip/reverse timing in 2-player games
6. Strategic drawing decisions (when to draw vs pass)
7. War card stacking (+2 on +2)
8. Endgame wild card usage
