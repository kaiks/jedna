# SmartRuby Agent - Enhanced Jedna AI Player
#
# This agent implements sophisticated strategies for playing Jedna (UNO):
# - Wild card conservation (saves wd4 for critical moments)
# - War handling (uses reverse cards to counter +2/wd4 attacks)
# - Defensive play (disrupts opponents when they have UNO)
# - Chain detection (identifies card sequences)
# - Skip chain recognition (wins with multiple skip cards)
# - Isolated number preference (plays cards with no matches first)
#
# Current performance: 57% win rate against SimpleAgent
# Tested with 17 strategic scenarios in test_smarter_agent.rb
#
# Usage: ./smarter_agent.rb (communicates via JSON on stdin/stdout)
